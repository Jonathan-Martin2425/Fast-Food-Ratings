### Fast-Food-Ratings 
### Jonathan Martin, Willeam Mendez, Carlos Lopez
  In this project we will be created a website where user can input and rate fast food  and their workers from 
  different types of fast food place and specific locations where they work. This will include separating different 
  types of fast food places then locations for each type and lastly all the kinds of workers in each location. 
  Users will be the ones to rate the food, add different workers and rate them too for each location as well as rate 
  them on different attributes, like speed and kindness for the workers and price, taste or quality. 
  Then we will have to determine the different types of fast food, the specific locations and the food they have.
